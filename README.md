# Neutron propagation and detection simulation
Simulating neutron detection using various gas-filled nuclear detector configurations in Geant4.

The ```doc``` directory contains the presentation that I created for the ISR-1 Student Symposium and the 2020 Los Alamos National Lab Student Symposium, with the corresponding LA-UR number. The ```doxygen_documentation``` directory contains Doxygen-generated documentation of the code. 

depends: Geant4, CADMesh
