Approaches to learning about Geant4
===================================
Geant4 comes pre-packaged with extensive examples of running programs for various purposes, and this is a very valuable resource. Obtaining general ideas and concepts from texts and presentations, however, is still valuable. This project was created as a companion for a presentation on Geant4, and the presentation is in the ``doc`` directory under the root directory for the project. This will give you a good conceptual introduction to Geant4. Other presentations and documentation on the internet can get you started with more details, but using the examples as reference for how different pieces of a Geant4 project fit together is still very useful.
